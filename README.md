## WHOI Argo Database Front End

Front end of http://argo.whoifloatgroup.org

Built primarily using React, these pages display key Argo fleet monitoring data tables and graphs. The pages are used to identify sensor and platform failures, and to track floats as they are prepared for deployment. The back end can be found at /argo-db-backend
