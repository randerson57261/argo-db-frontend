## WHOI Argo Database Front End

Front end of argo.whoifloatgroup.org

Built using primarily React, these pages display key fleet monitoring data tables and graphs. The pages are used to identify sensor and platform failures, and to track assets as they are prepared for deployment. The back end can be found at github.com/boom-lab/bgc-db
